Text Summarization with TextRank (via PyTextRank) and LSA (via sumy).

summary.py requires corpora to work - unrar the corpus.7z archive (in code/corpus) to get them (subsets of DUC 2004, WikiHow-Dataset and Multi-News). The corpus+results.7z file contains, in addition to the contents of corpus.7z, completed summaries of the 3 corpora, with TextRank, PositionRank and LSA.
